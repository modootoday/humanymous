# Runtime application operational integration

## What was measured

This is the follow-through contract/evidence cover, not a successful execution
receipt. Contracts R01-R17 are accepted/proposed as individually recorded in
plan:root/20261107061820 and sot:root/runtime-application v0.3. New runtime
implementation is unvalidated; actual baseline test count0 due to lock refusal.

R02 server source and two shared-client native fixture tests are now authored.
Current-source tests/runtime/browser/Docker remain NOT_RUN. An intermediate
production-only check passed before final edits and has no exact manifest; it is
not attributed to this checkpoint. Only owned formatting and public-only spec
syntax checks are current (0errors/1unrelated existing binary warning).

## How to read it

Heavy validation is held for user-requested memory triage. Do not infer browser,
human/keyboard/AT, capture, management, service or full product qualification from
this document's existence or predecessor component results. Raw history belongs
to private evidence:root/20261107061820; public attachments will contain only
sanitized outcomes/metadata/hash commitments with LF/stored-byte checks.

MSRV job128338631933 explicitly executed runtime15tests with15passed/0failed/
0ignored/0filtered, including the native shared-client ACK fixture. That source
predates later management/stream/admission/shared-owner work. These are native
fixture/component results with client-asserted report and mock audit, not actual
browser/human or full witnessed product evidence. Latest source remains NOT_RUN.
Private captured CLI stdout (not original HTTP response bytes) is attached under
evidence:root/20261107061820; sanitized exact-source summary is attached under
public evidence:root/20261107061821. Other failed native probe details remain
unrecovered; no success is inferred. No rerun/dispatch occurred.
